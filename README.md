Convolution: is taking /collecting  the required image data from  2D image using kernels. Collecting about edges,colors and many features. 

Filters/Kernels: Filters/ Kernels are  hardware used to collect/select the image data from  2D image  based on edges,colors /many features.

Epochs:Epoch is viewing the whole or complete image once. Many number of epoch form Epochs. 

1x1 convolution:  merging/ combining  features done by special kernel of 1X1. Maps input pixel with all its channels to o/p pixel

3x3 convolution: is collecting by selecting the image data from the 2D image using 3x3 kernel , size will be reduced by 2 in the output. 

Feature Maps:is the output after applying filter/kernels using some activation function at each layer

Activation Function:is a method for choosing/selecting the image features/data from 2D image when we use kernels or do convolution

Receptive Field:part of the image that is visible to one filter at a time, we can increase by adding convolution layers
